🧠 Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction Analysis
Using IBM SPSS Modeler 18.6

📊 Overview

This project focuses on Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction using IBM SPSS Modeler 18.6.
The goal is to understand customer behavior, group customers based on spending and loyalty, and identify which segments are most likely to churn.

By applying K-Means Clustering for segmentation and CHAID Decision Tree for churn prediction, this analysis provides actionable insights to improve customer retention, loyalty, and overall business performance.

🎯 Objectives

⦁	Segment customers into distinct groups using K-Means Clustering.

⦁	Classify customers as VIP Customers, Loyal Regulars, or Budget Spenders.

⦁	Predict churn probability using the CHAID Model.

⦁	Identify which customer segment shows highest churn risk and which shows lowest.

⦁	Derive business recommendations to strengthen customer loyalty and engagement.

🧩 Tools & Techniques Used

⦁	IBM SPSS Modeler 18.6

⦁	K-Means Clustering (for segmentation)

⦁	CHAID Decision Tree Model (for churn prediction)

⦁	Data Preparation Nodes – Type, Derive, and Select

⦁	Visualization Nodes – Graphs and Charts for insights

⚙️ Methodology

1️⃣ Data Preparation

⦁	Imported dataset into IBM SPSS Modeler.

⦁	Cleaned and transformed data using Filter, Select, and Derive nodes.

⦁	Standardized key variables like Income, Spending Score, and Tenure for clustering.

2️⃣ Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)

Customers were segmented into three behavioral clusters:

🏆 VIP Customers – High income, frequent spending, and strong loyalty.

💎 Loyal Regulars – Moderate income and spending with consistent engagement.

💰 Budget Spenders – Low income and less spending activity.

3️⃣ Churn Prediction (CHAID Model)

⦁	Applied the CHAID Decision Tree to predict customer churn.

⦁	Determined which segment is more likely to churn based on demographic and behavioral patterns.

⦁	Extracted the most influential variables driving churn.

4️⃣ Evaluation

⦁	Evaluated model accuracy using risk estimate and classification results.

⦁	Interpreted variable importance to understand churn drivers across segments.

📈 Key Insights

⦁	Budget Spenders show the highest churn risk, mainly due to low engagement and price sensitivity.

⦁	Loyal Regulars have a moderate churn rate, often affected by service satisfaction.

⦁	VIP Customers exhibit the lowest churn probability, driven by high loyalty and personalized experiences.

🚀 How to Use

⦁	Open IBM SPSS Modeler 18.6.

⦁	Import the dataset (.csv) and project stream file (.str).

⦁	Run the K-Means Clustering node to create customer segments.

⦁	Apply the CHAID Model to analyze churn prediction for each segment.

⦁	View cluster charts, decision tree outputs, and churn probability results.

🧾 Learning Outcomes

⦁	Practical understanding of K-Means Clustering for segmentation.

⦁	Implementation of CHAID Decision Tree for churn prediction.

⦁	Enhanced ability to interpret segmentation and churn analytics.

⦁	Hands-on experience in IBM SPSS Modeler workflow.

📘 Business Recommendations

⦁	Focus retention campaigns on Budget Spenders with discounts or loyalty rewards.

⦁	Maintain personalized engagement for VIP Customers to ensure continued loyalty.

⦁	Monitor Loyal Regulars for declining usage trends and take proactive action.
